# Interview with Richard Kasperowski on high-performance teams

**Stephen Harrison**: Let me introduce Richard Kasperowski. Richard and I worked together a while
back and have been friends ever since. Along the way, Richard has become a recognized expert
in an interesting and relevant field. 

**SH**: Richard, welcome. Thanks for taking time to chat.

**Richard Kasperowski**: No problem. Thanks for your interest.

**SH**: What's your elevator pitch?

**RK**: I'm an author, teacher, coach, consultant, I focus on teams, helping people build and maintain teams in a state of high performance. I do a lot of work with some toolsets called the Core Protocols, with Agile Development, with Open Space technology. And I teach a couple of courses. One at Harvard University called Agile Software Development and one at Boston University called Spark. It's an innovation program for teams of students creating new products together.

**SH**: You're one of the best presenters I've seen at workshops. What's your secret?

**RK**: It's a funny question. Because the first time I spoke at a conference I really sucked. This was about 25 years ago or something. I decided to speak at a conference because I thought is was something that, I don't know, cool people did, smart people did, successful people did. And I got into this conference and I showed up wearing a suit and a tie because I thought that's what you did when you went to a conference. And I basically read the slides to the audience and it was like I was a robot because I was so scared of being in front of the audience. The feedback I got at the end was that you had good material but you looked liked you were really nervous: You should try changing the tone of your voice once in a while.

So I guess, Stephen, I know you do a lot of things that I call Agile like continuous integration/continuous delivery and so on. Maybe this old idea from Extreme Programming: If it's hard and you do it all the time it becomes easier. So I just do it a lot now. It was hard. But I still liked it. So I did it more. Practice, practice, practice. Now I don't feel so scared talking to people and a little bit of my personality comes through.

**SH**: Staying with workshops for a moment. I notice you get people to engage in your exercises and overcome their reluctance. Tell us how to do that too.

**RK**: I think this is all about people feeling safe. And by safe I mean the opposite of a fight-or-fight response. So how do people feel safe? There's a really common facilitator technique for people to feel safe. You do an activity and you ask people to do it as a solo activity. That's totally safe: You can do the activity in your head, on a piece of paper. Totally safe: Nobody sees what you wrote, nobody hears what your idea was. Next level up is people pair together on the same activity or something similar. And it's easy because people basically have their answer written down and basically just read their answer to each other. But they're together in these small groups and they end making a new friend. And the next level up ... it's pairs of pairs. And the next level up is 4 until you have the whole room.

This scaffolding helps people feel safe. Whatever you're doing, find some scaffolding, some framework in which people can feel safe with each other. To avoid that fight-or-flight response. When people are experiencing fight or flight there's all this cortisol and adrenaline in their bodies. And they can't think, they can't be creative, and they can't participate. They can't even hear what you're saying. They're just worried about themselves, trying to defend themselves. And what we really want with this scaffolding is serotonin, dopamine, oxytocin. These are the chemicals in your body that make you feel good, help you connect with each other, that put you in a state of flow and high creativity. That's what we want in people we work with and care about.

**SH**: Nice. In your travels around the world helping people build high-performance teams, what have been some of the consistence and challenging themes?

**RK**: Continuing on this idea of safety, you can't just tell people to do more safety with each other at work. We have some idea of what that means but nobody knows how to do safety. So psychological safety is this idea that relates to high-performing teams. We feel safe when we're together. We're in this state where we're not experiencing this fight-or-flight response. How do you feel safe together? The first thing is everything is opt-in. And it's totally OK to opt out. So invitation. And the second step is share how you're feeling with each other. Yeah ... that's crazy stuff!

The first idea, as soon as I share it the manager kind of people are like "Wait a minute, if I don't command people to come to a meeting, or I don't tell them what to do, they won't do anything. That won't work." And the second one, share how you're feeling with each other, "Well no! I just want to write code. We don't do feelings here."

But actually, if you look at the science and the research of the actual behaviors of high-performing teams they do these things. They opt in, they do things because they want to do things. They solve problems the way they want to solve them. And they share how they're feeling with each other. When they're happy they say so, when they're mad they say so, when they're sad they say so. They connect with each other better. They become friends.

And you and I, Stephen. I talk about that team we were on a CentrePath as one of the best teams in my life. And I say we got lucky. We didn't really know what we were doing. If we look back at that, we became friends and could people do that again on purpose? How do you become friends? You decide you want to. Nobody makes you do it: It's opt-in. And you share with each other. Things about yourself, including how you're feeling.

**SH**: Are there some occupations, industries that push back the most on these ideas? How do you work around peoples' skepticism? A tough crowd.

**RK**: I think the profession we're in, the techie business resists the most. And I joke about when I work with finance companies. You're working at a techie finance company...

**SH**: Awkward silence

**RK**: I really mean like stock traders in finance. They don't believe in sharing feelings.

Many of us who do this kind of work, this techie kind of work or this finance kind of work, are really good at numbers and we're really good at logic. And this is part of why we think we don't need emotion at work. Because we've been so successful at work with just numbers and logic. It's like me. Why did I get into computers? Because I sucked at people. But I totally got numbers and logic. That was easy.

So I share with them the science and research on teams and team performance. The literature and the evidence is that teams who have high group emotional intelligence out-perform other teams. I make this case as a hook. If you believe in evidence-based thinking, if you're a numbers and logic person, then you more or less believe well-done research. So now, if you believe in evidence-based research and you want your team to be high performing ... damn it! Now you have to have high emotional intelligence in the team, because that's the logic case.

**SH**: Who are your greatest influences?

**SH**: We're not all familiar with some of the terms you frequently use: Core Protocols, Open
Space, and so on. What are these tools of the trade and what are we missing out by not know
what they are?

**SH**: I see the terms Psychological Safety and Emotional Intelligence showing more in your
work nowadays. Can you explain what they are relating to high-performance teams?

**SH**: Sneak peek. What's in your next book?

**SH**: Let's put all this together. What does a typical engagement look like start to finish?

**SH**: How do you know when you're really making a difference?

**SH**: In the new normal COVID, what are the new ways you work with people?

**SH**: What are your next challenges
